# DiscordFileMaster Version 1.0.3
This program allows the user to split large files into 8 MB chunks for upload to Discord. It can also merge the 8 MB chunks back together. This is very useful for people who want to send large files in Discord to friends or use Discord as a storage medium for large files.

## File Splitter
The File Splitter is designed to take one large file and split it into 8 MB chunks. To use this, click "Select file" and specify the file you wish to split. Then click "Select Folder" and specify the folder you wish the pieces to be placed in. Finally click "Split Files" to finish the operation. That folder will open automatically upon completion.

## File Joiner
The File Joiner is designed to take a folder of 8 MB chunks made by the File Splitter and merge it back into one large file. To use this, click "Select Input" and specify the folder with the file chunks to be linked (make sure you don't have random chunks from previous splits in this folder, this could cause unexpected behaviour).  Then click "Select Output" and specify the folder you want the merged file to be placed into. Finally, specify the filename and extension of the newly merged file and press "Join Button" to finish the operation. If you have "Launch file on completion" checked, the file wil open automatically. Regardless, the folder with the merged file will open.
